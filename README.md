# Agile_MVC_Permissions

Cloud-ready agile project management application built with a **Python MVC architecture**, designed to demonstrate expertise in **Agile methodologies**, **role-based access control**, and **modern deployment practices**.

This project implements **contextual role-based access control (RBAC)** with **Linux-style permissions** for managing projects, epics, user stories, and tasks. Permissions are assigned at different hierarchy levels (project, epic, task) and vary depending on the userâ€™s role in that context (Administrator, Technical, QA, Stakeholder, etc.).

## Features
- **Agile Methodology Demonstration**: Kanban/Scrum workflows with project hierarchy.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Contextual permissions using Linux-style `rwx` patterns.
- **Cloud-Ready Design**: Prepared for deployment on AWS.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Includes Docker and Kubernetes configurations.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Modular architecture supporting scalability and cloud best practices.
